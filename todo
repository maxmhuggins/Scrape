To Do For Scraper:

- Write docs so someone else can use
- Handle dependencies, again so someone else can use
- Make a list of tasks that changed from test to To-Do for the morning meeting
- Make different sprint selectable
	- Maybe instead of this just make several reports from a single run
- Allow user to make several reports in one sweep
- Make dictionary importable so it is easier to add people
- Consolidate VSeries options?

Need to define the scope of certain sections of the code, seperate them into
classes so it is easier to read and use.

Need more comments.

In the end, I will need some method of storing old tasks so that the task 
report has older tasks on it. Possibly just use a .txt file to store the
old strings and just append them at the end of the tex file.   - Or maybe, I 
dont...? I mean no one is looking at the old tasks so who gives. 

Wrap up in pretty bow so others can use.
    To do this: creaete setup.py file
                Maybe use py2exe to make an exe file
                
It would be really snazzy if it saw that a tester's name is assigned to a to-do
or in progress task that it would move that task to test.
If I get close to end of the document then clear page

Associate task with the PBI in the report?
