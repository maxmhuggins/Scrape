To Do For Scraper:

- Write docs so someone else can use
- Handle dependencies, again so someone else can use
- Make a list of tasks that changed from test to To-Do for the morning meeting
- Make different sprint selectable
	- Maybe instead of this just make several reports from a single run
- Allow user to make several reports in one sweep
- Make dictionary importable so it is easier to add people
- Consolidate VSeries options?
